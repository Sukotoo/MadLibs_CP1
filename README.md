# MadLibs_CP1
Project Instructions:

Objective:
In this project, youâ€™ll create a Mad Libs game using Python. Mad Libs are a  word game where you create a silly story by filling in blanks with random parts of speech (nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, etc.).
Your task is to write a program that prompts the user for different types of words and then uses those words to generate a funny story.
Directions:
Create a Story Template
Design a story with placeholders for different types of words. For example:
"Once upon a time, there was a [noun] who loved to [verb] with their [adjective] [noun]."
Gather User Input
Your program should ask the user to input the following:
A person's name (make sure the name is formatted in title case).
A month, day, and year (for a specific date).
At least 5 nouns, 5 verbs, 3 adjectives, and 2 adverbs.
Replace Placeholders
Use the words provided by the user to replace the placeholders in your story template. This should be done using f-strings to format the output.
Display the Final Story
After gathering all the inputs, display their name, followed by a new line, the date (mm/dd/yy), followed by a new line, then the completed story to the user with the words they provided
